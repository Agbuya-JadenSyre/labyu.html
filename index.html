<h1>Saksi ang Langit</h1>
<p>I often wonder what I did<br>
to deserve your love.<br>
I feel ko lucky every single day and<br>
I don't think theres anything.<br>
<br>
I could write to truly express<br>
how much you mean to me.<br>
You feel like home<br>
<br>
specially when you have your loving arms around me.<br>
 I have never felt a  love like this<br>
until I met you.<br>
I think you deserve the world<br>
<br>
 so I will give you as much of it as I can.<br>
and I am always here for you to lean on <br>
my shoulder is forever yours to cry on.<br>
I love you and will always love you through it all.<br>
<br>
 I cant wait to see how our relationship grows,<br>
 I cant wait for the memories we make,<br>
and I cant Wait To be proud of you every step of the way.<br>
I love you.<br>
Wala na 'kong ibang mahihiling <br>
Saksi ang langit sa 'tin <br>
<br>
</p>

<h2>WOW YEY BABI LOOK MAANGAS BA</h2>
<p>babi do you still love me po</p>
